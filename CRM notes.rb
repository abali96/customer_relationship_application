#before, we used the waterfall model, which sucked because clients don't know what they want and there's no process of re-evaluation

#now we want to use iterative development (create MVP to show client/beta)
#helps you be flexible about where you're going

#user stories:
#pivotal tracker (HUGE for ruby/rails devs but not free), trello, etc.(basecamp) are used to manage to-dos and client inputs?
#OR, just copy all your user stories into a notepad
