Customer Relationship Application (CRM)
=================================

Bitmaker Labs assignment:

This assignment followed a lesson on "Thinking Like a Developer". As such, this was our first interaction with user stories, creating meaningful classes, initialize methods, and "importing" files.
The CRM as coded here is a predecessor to the web application built later in the course.
