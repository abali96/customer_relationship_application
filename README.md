Customer Relationship Application (CRM)
=================================

Bitmaker Labs assignment:

This assignment followed a lesson on "Thinking Like a Developer". As such, this was our first interaction with user stories, creating meaningful classes, initialize methods, and "importing" files. The CRM completes basic CRUD actions to manage personal contacts.
The assignment as coded here is a predecessor to the web application built later in the course, which uses the gem Sinatra.
